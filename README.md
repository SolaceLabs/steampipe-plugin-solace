# Solace PubSub+ Cloud + Steampipe

## Overview
The goal is to retrieve information on [Solace PubSub+ Cloud](https://solace.com/products/platform/cloud/) resources via SQL queries using Solace plugin for Steampipe.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open-source framework for querying, analyzing, and working with data from various sources. It provides a unified and declarative way to interact with disparate data sources, such as databases, cloud providers, and APIs, using SQL syntax.

Plugins are what Steampipe uses to define the schema for remote resources. The Solace plugin for Steampipe defines which tables are available and performs API calls to query those resources.

3. Run a query

```sql
select
  id,
  name,
  stats
from
  solace_application_domain;
```

```
